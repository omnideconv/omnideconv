\usage{
build_model(
  single_cell_object,
  cell_type_annotations = NULL,
  method = deconvolution_methods,
  batch_ids = NULL,
  bulk_gene_expression = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  cell_type_column_name = NULL,
  markers = NULL,
  assay_name = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{single_cell_object}{A matrix with the single-cell data. Rows are genes,
columns are samples. Row and column names need to be set. Alternatively a SingleCellExperiment
or an AnnData object can be provided. In that case, note that cell-type labels need to be
indicated either directly providing a vector (cell_type_annotations) or by indicating the
column name that indicates the cell-type labels (cell_type_column_name). (Anndata: obs object,
SingleCellExperiment: colData object).}

\item{cell_type_annotations}{A vector of the cell type annotations. Has to be in the same order
as the samples in single_cell_object.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the method.
Supported methods for which a signature/model can be built are
AutoGeneS, BSeq-Sc, DWLS, CIBERSORTx, MOMF, Scaden}

\item{batch_ids}{A vector of the ids of the samples or individuals.}

\item{bulk_gene_expression}{A matrix of bulk data. Rows are genes, columns are samples. Necessary
for MOMF and Scaden, defaults to NULL. Row and column names need to be set}

\item{verbose}{Whether to produce an output on the console.}

\item{cell_type_column_name}{Name of the column in (Anndata: obs, SingleCellExperiment: colData),
that contains the cell-type labels. Is only used if no cell_type_annotations vector is
provided.}

\item{markers}{Named list of cell type marker genes. This parameter is only used by BSeq-sc.
The type of gene identifiers (names(markers)) must be the same as the ones used as feature/row
names in the single_cell_object.}

\item{assay_name}{Name of the assay/layer of the single_cell_object that should be used to extract the data}

\item{...}{Additional parameters, passed to the algorithm used}
}
\value{
The signature matrix. Rows are genes, columns are cell types.
}
\description{
The single_cell_object is expected to have rownames() and colnames()
