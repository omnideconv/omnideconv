Scaden is trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to engineer discriminative features that confer robustness to bias and noise, making complex data preprocessing and feature selection unnecessary. We demonstrate that Scaden outperforms existing deconvolution algorithms in both precision and robustness. A single trained network reliably deconvolves bulk RNA-seq and microarray, human and mouse tissue expression data and leverages the combined information of multiple datasets. Because of this stability and flexibility, we surmise that deep learning will become an algorithmic mainstay for cell deconvolution of various data types.

abstract={The rapid development of single-cell transcriptomic technologies has helped uncover the cellular heterogeneity within cell populations. However, bulk RNA-seq continues to be the main workhorse for quantifying gene expression levels due to technical simplicity and low cost. To most effectively extract information from bulk data given the new knowledge gained from single-cell methods, we have developed a novel algorithm to estimate the cell-type composition of bulk data from a single-cell RNA-seq-derived cell-type signature. Comparison with existing methods using various real RNA-seq data sets indicates that our new approach is more accurate and comprehensive than previous methods, especially for the estimation of rare cell types. More importantly, our method can detect cell-type composition changes in response to external perturbations, thereby providing a valuable, cost-effective method for dissecting the cell-type-specific effects of drug treatments or condition changes. As such, our method is applicable to a wide range of biological and clinical investigations.},

abstract={Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.},

These transformations significantly improve decomposition performance compared to existing methods when there is significant technical variation in the generation of the reference profile and observed bulk expression. Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous. When applied to subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression datasets with both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data, Bisque replicates previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes across abundant and rare cell types.

Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing.
    Results:
    We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures. A snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune\_deconvolution\_benchmark. An R package allows the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract = {Systems biology is an approach to comprehensively study complex interactions within a biological system. Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination. Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. This cell type-specific information provides a more comprehensive approach to monitor vaccine responses.},

	abstract = {Tissues are complex systems of interacting cell types. Knowing cell-type proportions in a tissue is very important to identify which cells or cell types are targeted by a disease or perturbation. When measuring such responses using RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq masks cellular heterogeneity. Hence, several computational methods have been proposed to infer cell-type proportions from bulk RNA samples. Their performance with noisy reference profiles highly depends on the set of genes undergoing deconvolution. These genes are often selected based on prior knowledge or a single-criterion test that might not be useful to dissect closely correlated cell types. In this work, we introduce AutoGeneS, a tool that automatically extracts informative genes and reveals the cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA samples. AutoGeneS requires no prior knowledge about marker genes and selects genes by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria: minimizing the correlation and maximizing the distance between cell types. It can be applied to reference profiles from various sources like single-cell experiments or sorted cell populations. Results from human samples of peripheral blood illustrate that AutoGeneS outperforms other methods. Our results also highlight the impact of our approach on analyzing bulk RNA samples with noisy single-cell reference profiles and closely correlated cell types. Ground truth cell proportions analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the accuracy of the predictions of AutoGeneS in identifying cell-type proportions. AutoGeneS is available for use via a standalone Python package (https://github.com/theislab/AutoGeneS).},

SCDC adopts an ENSEMBLE method to integrate deconvolution results from different scRNA-seq datasets that are produced in different laboratories and at different times, implicitly addressing the problem of batch-effect confounding. SCDC is benchmarked against existing methods using both in silico generated pseudo-bulk samples and experimentally mixed cell lines, whose known cell-type compositions serve as ground truths. We show that SCDC outperforms existing methods with improved accuracy of cell-type decomposition under both settings. To illustrate how the ENSEMBLE framework performs in complex tissues under different scenarios, we further apply our method to a human pancreatic islet dataset and a mouse mammary gland dataset. SCDC returns results that are more consistent with experimental designs and that reproduce more significant associations between cell-type proportions and measured phenotypes.}",

The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce “weighted-nearest neighbor” analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.}

abstract = { The immune system has evolved complex effector mechanisms to protect the host against a diversity of pathogenic organisms and regulatory adaptations that can curtail pathological sequelae of inflammatory events, prevent autoimmunity, and assist in tissue repair. Cancers, by virtue of their local manifestations of tissue dysfunction and destruction, inflammation, and genomic instability, can evoke these protective mechanisms, which support the progression of tumors and prevent their immune eradication. Central to these processes is a subset of CD4+ T cells, known as regulatory T (Treg) cells, that express the X chromosome-linked transcription factor FOXP3. In addition to their critical role in controlling autoimmunity and suppressing inflammatory responses in diverse biological settings, Treg cells are ubiquitously present in the tumor microenvironment where they promote tumor development and progression by dampening antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, Treg cells can directly support the survival of transformed cells through the elaboration of growth factors and interacting with accessory cells in tumors such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Current insights into the biology of tumor-associated Treg cells have opened up opportunities for their selective targeting in cancer, with the goal of alleviating their suppression of antitumor immune responses while maintaining overall immune homeostasis. }
